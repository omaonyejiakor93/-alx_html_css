- tweets.html: Extra page to demonstrate consistent layout.
- base.css: Provided base styles for standard styling.
- styles.css: My custom styles (Flexbox, colors, layout, responsiveness).

## ✨ Features

- Clean layout using Flexbox (`<header>`, <main>, <article>, <aside>, `<footer>`).

- Scrollable <article> and <aside> sections.
- Logo added with spacing and alignment using Flexbox.
- Clear typography and color scheme for readability.
